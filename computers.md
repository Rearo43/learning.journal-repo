# Computers 101

> Yes this is called "Computers 101" because here you'll learn what all the ones and zeros are all about in regards to a computer.

#### First lets start with the basics. 
> Four things that all computers do
1. Input `what you tell the computer to do...`
2. Storage `to be stored and...`
3. Process `then processed to create...`
4. Output `a physical response.`

#### HOW Computers Work

* Each wire can be on (1) or off (0). This means one wire can give two answers. `Example: True and False, Yes and No, 1 and 0.` This is called a Bit. The more Bits the more information you can communicate.

Above is how dog would be numerically written in the first line and in the second line using the Binary numerical system.
The Decimal system has a 1s,10s,100s, and 1000s spot the Binary system in place of those slotes has 1s,2s,4s,8s and so on. The more wires a computer has the more slotes.
##### So you may be asking well that explains words but what about picture, video, and sound.
* Very simply put it looks a little like this 
> Pictures are broken down into pixels which are broken down into colors. And each small shade and color difference has numbers assigned to them which can be represented by the Binary numerical system.

#### Key Vocabulary 
* Not- a circuit that ONE wire goes through and is flipped 
* And- a circuit two wires go through that always come out as one wire thats 0 unless both starting wires are 1s
* Adder- a circuit that adds the value of two bits (wires)
* Bit- a single wire that can express 1 or 0
* CPU- Central Processing Unit, these calculate information
* Input- converts physical requests to binary information
* Output- converts binary information to a physical response 
* Hardware- what we can see so chips, wires, speakers, and plugs
* Software- what we can't see things that are working behind the scenes so for instance binary code, or HTML
