### About Me
My name is Reagan Roberts born March 19, 1997.  I got a fullride scholarship to Central Connecticut State University a small D1 school. That's where I met my girlfriend of three years, she's from Sacramento, CA and was there on a Volleyball scholarship. Sports have always been the most important part of my life. I learned the value of sports and what it took to play at a high caliber from my dad [Ray Roberts](http://www.therayroberts.com/about/), he was drafted 10th overall in the '92 NFL draft.   February 2, 2016 I had an accident where I broke every bone below both knees, both my wrists, fractured my hip and spine, had a collapsed lung AND FINALLY had a small stroke. I spent three months in the hospital, took me about a year to be able to walk again, and I've had about 25 surgeries in the past four years. That put me in a very dark place not being able to be physically active and loosing the ability to play basketball competitivly again. It has taken me four years but I'm just starting to find interest and excitment in things again to replace the hole that basketball filled, and one of those things is Coding. I'm very excited to be here and very excited to learn. ![Me](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rearo43/learning.journal-repo/master/Screen%20Shot%202020-03-16%20at%2011.26.08%20PM.png)
