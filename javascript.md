* I always thought that the symbols in code were almost looked at the same as you would math but to find out that's not the case. For example "=" doesnt mean equal nor do you say it that way in a sentence. To verbally say your code line "=" is the word "Is". 
* I've also never really known what JavaScript is but after learning the small amount we did today, HTML and CSS make more sense now that I can see how they're all related to each other.
* New vocabulary word "Boolean" meaning something has only two answers ex. Yes and No, Good and Bad, Off and On, True and False.
* More vocabulary "Concatination" which means add
* "else" is a default after "else if"
* "else if" is used to evaluate 
* Data type ' ' = `<strength>`
