Below you'll find some simple tips to help you learn Markdown Syntax.



### Word Alteration

1. **Bold** or __Bold__ `1. **Bold** or __Bold__`
2. *Italics* or _Italics_ `2. *Italics* or _Italics_`
3. _You **can** do both_ `3. _You **can** do both_`
4. ***Or everything altered with both*** `4. ***Or everything altered with both***`
5. ~~Strick~~through `5. ~~Strick~~through`
6. # Header `6. # Header`
* ### Or smaller `### Or smaller`
* #### `####`
* ###### You can go up to `You can go up to`
>Above ^ these are the different Headers you have to choose from.

You can also do numbered (ordered) lists like below, they will both appear the same as the numbered list above.

1. These are `1. These are`
1. all ones `1. all ones`
1. in Markdown. `1. in Markdown.`

### Text Placement  

When you want to call out certain words or texts,
> you can quote them using Quote Text or `Quote Code.` 

`> you can quote...` `and for "Quote Code" put a backdash before and after the words you'd like highlighted.`

```
You can even create blocks for texts
```
```Do you see the difference in the block when forgetting to hit return inbetween the three backdashes before and after the text.```

### Inline Code / Links
* If you'd like to write inline code and have it appear on the webpage use a single backdash before and after.
`<header>`

* To link a URL use [Google](https://www.google.com) `[What word the links on](URL)`
* To link an Image use [Description of logo](URL to logo) The description will pop up when a user hovers over the image.
