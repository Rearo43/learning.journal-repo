* echo = will show you what shell you're using (should end in bash)
* ls = what is there (short for list)
* pwd = where we currently are 
* cd = change directories
* file.exe = an executable file
* file.txt = a plain text file
* file. png, .gif, .jpg = image 
* Case sensitive 
* Put single quotes around anything that has a space in it or use a backslash and that will allow the space to not mean a separation of the two words. 
* ls -a = list content of a directory, include hidden files
