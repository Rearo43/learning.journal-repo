> A growth midset is the mindset that nothings going to set you back.  It may take you longer than expected, it may take you longer than others but you will get there. Understanding not to compare yourself to others but come to terms that you'll get to the finishline on your own time, one way or another. 

## How to stay in a Groth [Mindset](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset)
1. Set realistic goals FOR YOURSELF.
  ```
  Be willing to alter those goals if needed.
  ```
2. Ask for Help.
3. Be willing to step away and come back to an obstacle with a new attack plan instead of giving up.
4. Block out time to practice.
